        Running any unauthorised search operations is both a risk to public safety and will potentially impede the work of the official search and recovery operation.
  content: |
      The high visibly of such search operations also heightens the risk of ‘copycat’ suicidal behaviour, especially in close proximity to where the missing person entered the water, e.g. the bridges and river banks.  Individuals who may be extremely vulnerable are usually attracted to such gatherings and to places associated with the loss of an individual.  Please note that statutory authorities cannot endorse or support unauthorised searches. However, if relatives insist in doing their own search, then FSR will issue the family, without prejudice, with safety guidelines which must be adhered to.

     - Persons searching should wear appropriate clothing for the weather conditions.
     - It is recommend that persons searching near the water’s edge wear a Life Jacket & that all other searchers wear high-vis clothing to enable boat crew to observe them on river banks.
     - If you have access to a pole or walking stick please use it to test the ground in front of you.
     - Always carry a mobile phone.
     - Be careful along the river’s edge. Search between the river’s edge and high water line.
     - If you approach rocks or large tress, try to walk around, not over, unless this means going to close to the edge.
     - DO NOT enter the Glar/mud. You may become stuck & need rescued.
     - DO NOT wade or enter the water.
     - DO NOT cross over any railings under any circumstances.
     - DO NOT cross over onto or walk along Rail Tracks.
     - In the event of finding any items of clothing etc. DO NOT TOUCH or remove. Please contact the PSNI on 101 who will in turn alert Foyle Search & Rescue 02871 313800.
     - Check the tidal tables and weather forecast prior to commencing the search. If you need any advice on tides please contact Foyle Search.
     - People who are searching are reminded that the river banks are extremely hazardous after dark.
     - Please when searching along railings or on any of the Bridges DO NOT lean over the railings as CCTV operators can not differentiate between a genuine searcher or a person who may be in need of help requiring immediate activation of the emergency services.
